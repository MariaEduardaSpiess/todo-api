# Todo API - Golang code sample

Hi there!

This is a golang API that I developed in a day just to show some golang code. It is not the state of art, it's missing some tests and some abstractions, but it does the job, and I wanted to show that I can get the work done.

This API has two endpoints: one to create a todo item and one to retrieve all the items created.

## Running
To run this code, we have a makefile:
- run `make docker-compose` to start a dynamodb on a docker container
- run `make dynamo-create-table` to create the necessary dynamodb table 
- run `make run` to start the golang code locally.
After that, you'll be able to open the swagger http://localhost:9000/todo/swagger/index.html#/ on your favorite browser and test the API.

I hope it goes well, otherwise I'll be ashamed.
